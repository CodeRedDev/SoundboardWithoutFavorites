# It's just a simple Soundboard DUUUH ;P
This repository contains a full working Android soundboard that is based on my YouTube playlist "How To: Android Soundboard" until part 8.

This soundboard has the functions to share sounds, set sounds as ringtone but does not contain the ability to add favorites.

If you want to have a soundboard with the favorites function and database support take a look at the main repository:
https://github.com/CodeRedDev/HowToAndroidSoundboard.git

I will add some extra branches with some functions that are not included in the main soundboard tutorials.
